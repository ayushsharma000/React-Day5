    <h3> 1) What is an Event in react ?</h3>
    <p>An event is an action that could be triggered as a result of the user action or system generated event. <br />
        For example, a mouse click, loading of a web page, pressing a key, window resizes, and other interactions are called events. <br />
        React has its own event handling system which is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. <br />
        The react event handling system is known as Synthetic Events. <br />
        The synthetic event is a cross-browser wrapper of the browser's native event. </p>

    <h3> 2) What is the memmory leak and how to overcome ?</h3>
    <p>Memory leaks in React applications are primarily a result of not canceling subscriptions made when a component was mounted before the component gets unmounted.</p>
    <br />
    <h3> 3) Explain reducer as pure function in redux </h3>
    <p> In redux, the reducers are the pure functions that contain the logic and calculation that needed to be performed on the state. <br />
        These functions accept the initial state of the state being used and the action type. It updates the state and responds with the new state. <br />
        This updated state is sent back to the view components of the react to make the necessary changes. Basically, In short, we can say that Reducerâ€™s work is to return the updated state and to also describe how the state changes.</p>
    <br />
    <h3> 4) What do you know about NPM ?</h3>
    <p>npm is an abbreviation used for the node package manager. It is a package manager for JavaScript. <br />
        It is the default package manager that comes with NodeJS when you install it. <br />
        It consists of a command-line interface and an online database of public packages and private packages that are paid which is called the npm Registry.</p>
